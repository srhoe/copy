# copy
This C program copies a file's contents to another file. It uses standard C libraries to handle byte-by-byte copying in binary mode.

1. Compile the C program (copy_file.c) using a C compiler.

     "gcc copy_file.c -o copy_file"

2. Run the compiled executable with two command-line arguments: the source file to copy from and the destination file to copy to.
"./copy_file source_file.txt destination_file.txt"
